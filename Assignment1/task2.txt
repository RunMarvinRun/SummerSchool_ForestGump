a)With the command “pwd” you can get the present working directory. After entering Euler the present path is: 
[mdroste@euler ~]$ pwd
/srv/home/mdroste

b) To find out which shell is running you can type following command:
[mdroste@euler ~]$ ps|grep $$
4887 pts/41   00:00:00 bash
This response shows that the shell we are using is of type 'bash'.

c) Using the “ls” command you can list files in the current directory. Possible flags are:
